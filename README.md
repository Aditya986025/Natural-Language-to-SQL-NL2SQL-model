# Natural-Language-to-SQL-NL2SQL-model
This project evaluates a Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) model using the transformer model `tscholak/cxmefzzi` from Hugging Face. The aim is to determine how accurately the model can translate natural language questions into executable SQL queries based on a given schema.
